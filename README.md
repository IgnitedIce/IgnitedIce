### My frameworks / CMS's
- Flutter
  - Intermediate knowledge
  - My goto framework for cross-platform development
- WordPress
  - WooCommerce expert
  - Plugin creator
- React.js
  - I love using React + MUI
- Chrome Development
  - I hate it, buy it can be useful

### My programming languages
- PHP
  - Despite its bad reputation, I actually like it
- Java
  - One of my first languages, where I discovered object-oriented programming
- JavaScript
  - As a web developer, it would have been very embarrassing if I didn't know JS
- Dart
  - I love it so much, should be recognized more and not only as the main Flutter language
- C
  - You can't consider yourself a programmer without knowing C IMO
- Shell scripting
  - Aweful syntax but infinite use-cases
- Python
  - Please don't ever talk to me if your main programming language is Pyth0n, yes I'm a big hater :)
- Go
  - I started learning Go for a personal project, and even though the syntax is very confusing to learn at first, I love it
- And hopefully more to come...
